Programming Challenge to find a MPC research engineer for HashCloak

**WARNING: Do not fork this repository or make a public repository containing your solution. Either copy it to a private repository or submit your solution via other means.**

At HashCloak, we have been trying to [seek a research engineer for our internal multiparty computation (MPC) projects](https://hackmd.io/@hashcloak/HJz2Xn3Z9) for quite some time now but it has proven to be a challenge. As such, we are taking a different approach to recruit someone for this role.

If you are interested, attempt the programming challenge below and send your solutions to info@hashcloak.com

## Challenge

Implement the robust reconstruction protocol from [Choudhury et al](https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/705.pdf).
You can use whatever programming language you want but those who write it in one of Go or Rust will have precedence.
For types, you can just create "fake" types in order to focus on the details of the algorithm. As such, we don't expect the implementation to compile to real values but we do expect the resulting implementation to compile
